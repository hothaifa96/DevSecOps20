## Project 1: Job Board with Resume Analyzer

###  Description:
A job board platform focused on DevOps roles. Applicants can apply to job postings and upload resumes. The backend performs basic NLP to score resumes against job descriptions.

###  Endpoints:
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST   | /jobs    | Create a new job post |
| GET    | /jobs    | List all job posts |
| GET    | /jobs/<job_id> | Get job details |
| PUT    | /jobs/<job_id> | Update job post |
| DELETE | /jobs/<job_id> | Delete job post |
| POST   | /apply/<job_id> | Apply to a job with resume |
| GET    | /applicants/<job_id> | List all applicants for a job |
| GET    | /applicants/<job_id>/<applicant_id> | View applicant details & score |
| POST   | /admin/login | Admin login |
| GET    | /admin/dashboard | View stats, job postings, and applications |
