## ðŸ”§ Project 4: Secure Secrets Manager

### ðŸ“˜ Description:
Build a small-scale secure secrets manager. Users can securely store API keys or sensitive credentials, share secrets via expiring links.

### ðŸ§ª Endpoints:
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST   | /secrets | Store a new secret (encrypted) |
| GET    | /secrets/<id> | Retrieve secret (if permissions allow) |
| DELETE | /secrets/<id> | Delete secret |
| POST   | /secrets/<id>/share | Generate one-time shareable link |
| GET    | /share/<token> | Access shared secret via token |
| POST   | /register | Register new user |
| POST   | /login | Authenticate user |
| GET    | /secrets | List userâ€™s secrets |
| PUT    | /secrets/<id> | Update secret metadata |

### Implementation Steps:

#### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure
1. **Initialize Flask Application**
   - Set up Flask project structure with separate folders for models, routes, and utilities
   - Configure virtual environment and install dependencies (Flask, cryptography, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
   - Set up configuration files for development and production

2. **Database Design & Setup**
   - Design schema for users, secrets, and shared tokens
   - Implement SQLAlchemy models for User, Secret, and ShareToken
   - Set up database migrations

3. **User Authentication System**
   - Implement user registration and login endpoints
   - Use password hashing for secure storage
   - Set up JWT or session-based authentication
   - Create authentication middleware for protected routes

#### Phase 2: Core Secrets Management Features
4. **Secret Storage & Encryption**
   - Integrate encryption (using AWS KMS, Fernet, or similar) for secret data at rest
   - Implement endpoint to store new secrets (encrypt before saving)
   - Add endpoint to retrieve and decrypt secrets (with permission checks)
   - Implement secret deletion

5. **Secret Metadata & Listing**
   - Allow users to update secret metadata (name, description, tags)
   - Implement endpoint to list all secrets for the authenticated user

#### Phase 3: Sharing & Expiring Links
6. **One-Time Shareable Links**
   - Implement endpoint to generate a one-time, expiring share link for a secret
   - Store share tokens with expiration and usage status
   - Create endpoint to access a secret via share token (enforce expiration and one-time use)

#### Phase 4: Security & Alerts
7. **Access Control & Auditing**
   - Enforce strict access control: users can only access their own secrets
   - Log access and sharing events for auditing
   - Implement rate limiting and input validation

8. **Alerting (Optional)**
   - Integrate email alerts (using AWS SES or SMTP) for suspicious activity or new shares

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Final Polish
9. **API Documentation**
   - Document all endpoints with request/response examples
   - Add code comments and docstrings
   - Write setup and deployment instructions

10. **Testing & Optimization**
    - Write unit and integration tests for all major features
    - Optimize encryption/decryption performance
    - Review for security best practices (OWASP, etc.)
